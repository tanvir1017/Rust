// How bits work in RUST :i32 :u8 -> what does it mean

The formula is =>
from -(2n - 1) to ((2n-1) - 1)
[!Link](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html)

by the formula => :i8 means -> -(28-1) to ((28-1) -1)
By the way the n is a power which represent the data type bits

so after calculating -128 to 128 is the value that means we can store value from -128 to 128. and if we go for 129 ti will give us an error

an addition :u8 follow this formula. Because of :u8 doesn't take any negative value
it can store numbers from 0 to 2n - 1, so a u8 can store numbers from 0 to 28 - 1, which equals 0 to 255. 2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2 = 256 -1 => value < 256 that means  from 0 - 255


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

i32 -> 32-bit signed integer. It can hold values from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.

u8 -> 8-bit unsigned integer. It can hold values from 0 to 255.
